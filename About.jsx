       <h1>Nisha's Cafe</h1>
        <i>" Australian style cafe that serves simple, natural food – including Vegan and Gluten Free options accompanied by authentic espresso coffee. Most coffee shops in the United States don’t do much with food and most restaurants don’t worry about coffee. The Australian café is a hybrid combining a strong coffee culture and a robust food culture under one roof in a welcoming, cozy and comfortable neighborhood café."</i>

    <h1>We also have a little attitude: </h1>
    <p> Café YOU has a cool, trendy shabby chic decor and an upbeat fun atmosphere with a whole lot of colorful idioms: brekkie (breakfast), avo (avocado), and “no worries” (you’re welcome).

It’s the perfect place to relax on your own or to catch up with friends while enjoying great coffee and great food.

Like in most Australian cafés one of our signature menu items is our “avocado smash”. Sometimes called an avocado toast, the perfect comfort food for any time of the day. We smash half a ripe avocado and some feta cheese onto a thick piece of toast (of your choice), season it with salt, pepper and chili flakes (optional), then give it a splash of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon.

In Australia, cafés play a central role in people’s lifestyle. Its where people hang out, where they meet up with friends and have business meetings; before work,
after a morning swim or working out, for breakfast, for lunch, a snack or just a coffee.

We hope Café YOU will become part of your neighborhood and lifestyle.</p>
